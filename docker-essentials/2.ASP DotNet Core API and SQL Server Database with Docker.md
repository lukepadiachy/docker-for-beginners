# üåê ASP.NET Core API & SQL Server Database With Docker

![Containerizing  Your ASP NET Core API  With Docker (2)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3a7d7de0-d2c1-4bcd-ad7c-0088c14f4f62)

This was an interesting one that took me about two days to figure out how it actually works after watching some videos on it. This definetly involves getting your hands dirty with some code. Please note that we are using `.NET 9`.
The idea with this doc is more for those interested in connecting their SQL Server which has been Dockerised with a ASP.NET Core Web API. I will be going through some of the code. This is more focused on connecting two pieces of a puzzle.
Once we have connected those pieces of the puzzle. We will see that a Docker file can basically be added at any point of your development process, I hope.

## Create Your ASP DotNet Core Web API
Keep in mind I'm using `.NET 9` , with that being said, I have made a small video so you can see how to create it in `Visual Studio`.
[Video Link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_yarqwPwK4E_cqg86MDsKcZU9I514VET/view?usp=sharing). If you are using `.NET 9` , note I have added swagger to it, as this does not come with ASP.NET Core Web API for `.NET9` , older versions should still have it. So if you decided to create your own repo for this on `.NET9`.
Here's a link to show you how to incorporate it in your project : [.NET9 Swagger Integration](https://github.com/Menayer/DotNet9-Swagger-Integration).

## Connect ASP DotNet Core Web API to a Dockerised SQL Server Database

### Adding Nuget Packages Needed

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f3deab8e-8584-4a53-a4ad-c73418c63005)

To do this for your own project:
- Right-Click on your api project (eg: mine is bookstore.Api )
- Head to **`manage nuget packages`**
- Make sure you are in the `Browse` tab
- Search `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore`
- Then install and accept
- That's just 1 , you got 3 more to do, you can simply add a dot at the end of `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore` and say `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design`, `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools` & `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer`

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7a70d309-2376-4ecf-aac1-57fe5d5eb870)


So if you do not have `.NET 9`, do not copy the packages Im providing below because these are for that.

```markdown
<PackageReference Include="Microsoft.AspNetCore.OpenApi" Version="9.0.0" />
<PackageReference Include="Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore" Version="9.0.0" />
<PackageReference Include="Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design" Version="9.0.0">
  <PrivateAssets>all</PrivateAssets>
  <IncludeAssets>runtime; build; native; contentfiles; analyzers; buildtransitive</IncludeAssets>
</PackageReference>
<PackageReference Include="Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer" Version="9.0.0" />
<PackageReference Include="Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools" Version="9.0.0">
  <PrivateAssets>all</PrivateAssets>
  <IncludeAssets>runtime; build; native; contentfiles; analyzers; buildtransitive</IncludeAssets>
</PackageReference>
<PackageReference Include="Swashbuckle.AspNetCore" Version="7.2.0" />
```

You can double-click on your api project to make sure all packages are there , rebuild/run your project to make sure everything is good.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2427a8bf-7134-4a16-9644-7877bb56afae)

### Adding Models
Now that we have our packages needed , **LET'S COOK**. We will be making sure that we add the information needed to set up our EF Core proceess, some might know this process already.

- Created a folder called **`Model`**
- Moved **`WeatherForecast.cs`** into that folder (OCD purposes)
- Created a class called **`Book.cs`**
- Added properties
- This will define our table for the database

```markdown
public class Book
{
    public int BookId { get; set; }
    public string Title { get; set; }
    public string Author { get; set; }
    public string Genre { get; set; }
    public decimal Price { get; set; }
    public int Pages { get; set; }
    public string Publisher { get; set; }
}
```
### Adding Configurations
So we got our model, lets take this piece of the puzzle and connect it.

- Created a folder called **`Data`**
- Adding a class in that folder called **`BookStoreDbContext.cs`**

   ```markdown
  public class BookStoreDbContext : DbContext
  {
    public BookStoreDbContext(DbContextOptions<BookStoreDbContext> options) : base(options)
    {
    }

    public DbSet<Book> Books { get; set; }
  }
  ```
- Adding another class in the **`Data`** Folder called **`BookConfiguration.cs`**
- Won't provide the code block because it is quite big , but this file is what we will use to seed our Database
- Head back to our **`BookStoreDbContext.cs`** class and add the code block below inside it
  ```markdown
  protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
  {
    base.OnModelCreating(modelBuilder);
    modelBuilder.ApplyConfiguration(new BookConfiguration());
  }
  ```
- something I picked up afterwards , if you do not add this , It will not seed your database with information.

  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/218265ea-f959-486d-89db-4058d250d27f)

- Head over to the **`Program.cs`**
- Let's add our DbService basically
  
  ```markdown
  builder.Services.AddDbContext<BookStoreDbContext>(options => {
    options.UseSqlServer(builder.Configuration.GetConnectionString
        ("BookStoreDatabaseConnection"));
  });
  ```

- Keep in mind at this point we dont have our connection string yet , so we going to add it in our **`appsettings.json`**

  ```markdown
  "ConnectionStrings": {
  "BookStoreDatabaseConnection": "Server=localhost, 1400;Database=BookStoreDb;Trusted_Connection=false;MultipleActiveResultSets=true;Encrypt=false;user id=sa;password=Str0ngPa$$word;"
  },
  ```
  
- This will be pointing at our Database in **Docker** , if you don't know how to do this, refer to [Containerizing Your SQL Server Database With Docker](https://github.com/lukepadiachy/docker-for-beginners/blob/main/docker-essentials/1.Containerizing%20Your%20SQL%20Server%20Database%20With%20Docker.md)
- So since we using of dockerised SQL Server from the get-go , be mindful of your port you used in the set up of your SQL Server on Docker , in my setup I used `1400` , so it would be `1400:1433`

  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f77c47d0-ddca-4abb-b819-5bc05c80a1d7)

### Adding Migrations
Since we cooked up our configurations and tables. We want to do some migration things.

- Head over to `Package Manager Console`
  
  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2ad3124c-26c8-4236-bc31-e36ffd400aff)

- now we got our terminal open
- Run **`add-migration InitialMigration`**, using this command will create a migration file for you
- Then run **`update-database`**, this will update our database with the seeding infromation and run scripts

  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bda29f71-3186-419a-85a6-cc732c3ec090)

- As long as you dont see red things in the terminal , this should be fine

- Now lets make sure the server is actually available
- Open **`Azure Data Studio`**
- Add a **`New Connection`**

  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cb8d8221-be6c-449d-9cbd-cf066259448e)

- Instead of using `Parameters` we can use `Connection String` , since we got this string inside our projects `appsettings.json`
- Copy `Server=localhost, 1400;Database=BookStoreDb;Trusted_Connection=false;MultipleActiveResultSets=true;Encrypt=false;user id=sa;password=Str0ngPa$$word;`

  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f58a6223-cc91-4db7-a5f7-5bf42bb768f8)

- Now Let's Connect
- We can actually see all our information

  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9d802e49-d27d-4872-8a20-26d7e734fd58)

- Right-Click on `Books` & Select `Top(1000)`
  
  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7790d61c-c1e3-458a-9b67-ff7a748275c8)

- Whoop Database with seeded information, isn't that cool ? that everything we did in code was now added to our Dockerised Database.

  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dee1afb9-b6ab-4ac2-9cad-38f7610658ca)

If you did this on your own(not following tutorial) you might run into two errors 

- **Network Related:** This means your container is not running for some reason in Docker Desktop
- **UserId or Requested Database does not exist:** Which makes sense if you did not `update-database` in **Visual Studio** because this creates the Tables with the seeded information for you. 
  
At this point we have a ASP.NET Core Web API Application taliking to our container.

### Add Controller
A controller is like a traffic cop that receives HTTP requests and decides what data or actions to return back to the client. We are going to add one for our **`Books`**. If you not too familiar with it , that's okay, I was shocked when I saw we could do this too

- Right-click on **`Controllers`**

  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4358ca72-ca55-4e71-818d-f7c2789c2699)

- Then select API underneath `Common`
- Once Clicked , Select `API Controller with actions, using Entity Framework`

  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/374ac5cf-4beb-4866-ad3d-0db7eea7e134)

- You will have another pop up
- Select your Model Class that you want the controller to be based on , I only have one , so I selected **`Book(BookStore.Api.Model)`**
- Select your DbContext Class, I only have one , but you could have many of these so select the one you need **`BookStoreDbCOntext(BookStore.Api.Data)`**
- Controller name will be generated for you , you can change this if you like
  
  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e2c565f6-a017-4034-b6f5-701830d1dd2c)

- Click add
- This will create your controller , if this did not work , it could mean there's maybe a mismatch between your Entity packages, not sure but found out haha.

  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f80315cb-142c-4a90-babf-071e4f86ac5f)

Don't forget to build your solution to make sure no errors popped up during this process.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2dfcfcf4-72c2-41bb-bda1-6de47c1fbe82)

## Adding a Docker File
We got our API project , we have connected it to a SQL Server Database. Now we have most of our things set for adding our Docker file after-the-fact. 

We going to look at two ways to do this and a light touch on ENV:

- [Visual Studio](#visual-studio)
- [Visual Studio Code](#visual-studio-code)
- [Environment Variables With Docker Added](#environment-variables-with-docker-added)


### Visual Studio
So when we created our API project , you would have noticed that there was a checkbox that said `Enable Container Support`, you could've easily added docker support from the jump, but we plan on doing the same process manually so we can have a feel of whats happening inside and pick up that this can be added at anytime of the development process.

- Right-click on the project
- Select `Add`
- Click on `Docker Support`
  
  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1f25e9d3-a9a3-43d1-bae3-1541eee931c9)

- Make sure your pop up things look similar to mine then click `OK`

  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0c05c845-eef5-41d8-aaab-e8dd571c0cd3)

- Commands will be running in your terminal after you done this

  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/abde233d-a069-4a3f-a26a-22a36c7d87f6)

- So hopefully the Docker File created has got all the information regarding your project in order to create the container.

  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b33d04a5-db1c-473a-811f-757353825310)

Let's break it down 

```markdown
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:9.0 AS base
USER $APP_UID
WORKDIR /app
EXPOSE 8080
EXPOSE 8081
```

**`mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:9.0`** | In order for our application to run , we need a base image which has basic intstructions on **HOW** to run our .NET application in the container
**`EXPOSE 8080`** | http traffic
**`EXPOSE 8081`** | https traffic
In previous versions of a docker file you might not see these ports


```markdown
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:9.0 AS build
ARG BUILD_CONFIGURATION=Release
WORKDIR /src
COPY ["BookStore.Api/BookStore.Api.csproj", "BookStore.Api/"]
RUN dotnet restore "./BookStore.Api/BookStore.Api.csproj"
COPY . .
WORKDIR "/src/BookStore.Api"
RUN dotnet build "./BookStore.Api.csproj" -c $BUILD_CONFIGURATION -o /app/build
```
This section basically says that we are building in release
**`COPY ["BookStore.Api/BookStore.Api.csproj", "BookStore.Api/"]`** | Copying over the source code
**`RUN dotnet restore "./BookStore.Api/BookStore.Api.csproj"`** | Restores all the nuget packages
**`RUN dotnet build "./BookStore.Api.csproj" -c $BUILD_CONFIGURATION -o /app/build`** | Then we doing a build


```markdown
FROM build AS publish
ARG BUILD_CONFIGURATION=Release
RUN dotnet publish "./BookStore.Api.csproj" -c $BUILD_CONFIGURATION -o /app/publish /p:UseAppHost=false
```
After the build is complete, then we publish

```markdown
FROM base AS final
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=publish /app/publish .
ENTRYPOINT ["dotnet", "BookStore.Api.dll"]
```
After the publish we are going to move to
**`WORKDIR /app`** | Working directory for the app
**`ENTRYPOINT ["dotnet", "BookStore.Api.dll"]`** | Whenever we run a .NET app , we running against this `.dll` , so when it runs , its like woohoo here's what you need to execute it 

### Visual Studio Code
This process will be slightly different from how we done it via the section at the start of this repo, because we used `compose` this is just the normal set up of the container for a single project (im guessing)

- Click on the top search bar or use the shortcut **`ctrl + shift + p`**

  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ae52adac-f6e4-4a9d-8b49-b8aa99b42b49)

- You will have this screen , Search **`Dcoker:Add Docker Files To Workspace`** or maybe it will be there for you, if you have done this before.

  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/33d81e97-f01e-4ef4-943c-52bd642b8c12)

- Here's the slight difference , you can select the ones Ive selected in the images , most of them have `recently used` next to it, those are the ones I selected
  1. ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e7495afd-7fd6-478a-b01f-e48fcd496148)
  2. ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/94cb9d4c-61f0-4309-b505-065ff0d3665a)
  3. ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/792b3573-ab25-4b06-a047-bbef9035ea7d)
  4. ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4548c186-3b03-4123-a835-3560aec40fe9)

Now we got it set up too, woohoo !

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1595d276-f49c-4694-93d9-1344c91e12a3)

Only big difference between Visual Studio & Visual Studio code is 
**`EXPOSE 5277`** | One port specified
**`ENV ASPNETCORE_URLS=http://+:5277`** | Represents the environment variable

### Environment Variables With Docker Added
Environment Variables in general make sure that your application runs the way you want it to.
So when you add a docker file into your project , it also makes some changes in your **`launchsettings.json`**

- Click on `Properties` folder , then click on `launchsettings.json`

  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/72db5848-77ee-48e1-80df-4fc457c11d8d)

so you normally dont mess inside here unless you know what you doing or want to specify something that you need.

- When we created the application, we had these

  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d6384b2c-17a1-4c15-aa72-9fa3c2632a73)

  You will notice in our `launchsettings.json` we have those specified almost similar to what we have in our appsettings for our database, only difference is , it is not a Connection String.
  It's a Profile "string" if you we want to match it like that 

- When we added Docker an extra profile was added

  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/62b70e20-9d10-498c-9987-31711b812318)

  ```markdown
  "Container (Dockerfile)": {
  "commandName": "Docker",
  "launchUrl": "{Scheme}://{ServiceHost}:{ServicePort}",
  "environmentVariables": {
    "ASPNETCORE_HTTPS_PORTS": "8081",
    "ASPNETCORE_HTTP_PORTS": "8080"
  },
  "publishAllPorts": true,
  "useSSL": true
  }
  ```

So basically if we ran `"http"`, the it will take us to the `"applicationUrl": "http://localhost:5277"` port , vice versa if we selected one of the others.
We also have `"environmentVariables":` | This defines our environment, so when we Publish an application it automatically goes to production , unless you specify directly like we doing in our source code.

## Testing Containerized Application
So now we got all that set up , lets run the container !

- Make sure that you got Docker Desktop Running , to confirm you can look in the bottom left corner to see if `engine is running`
- Hit the Container Button, We going to run this with debugging

  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0e042f2d-43b3-4f3a-be35-fb50e37b88e9)

After running you will notice that your Visual Studio has a new section or well , a panel that says `Containers`.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/540381b8-95f6-46c0-bfe9-e489033b04e5)

- On the left you will see you list of containers that Visual Studio picks up.
- You can actually stop and start the containers as you like from the containers section.
- Once clicking on a container you can check its environment variables

Let's check out what's happening in Docker desktop

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/749db1fd-e28f-4bd7-a50e-f7cc63363921)

We went to our image section and immediately we can see our image as 

- **`Name`** | bookstoreapi
- **`Tag`** | dev which is a default tag

So we dont have to click run on it inside the containers section, since we already ran it within Visual Studio , so they twinning actions at this point.

Let's run a quick test and see that we are in `Debug Mode`
We set a breakpoint on the get action for the **`BooksController.cs`**

Kabaam , breakpoint hit !

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/16d34933-1d43-4c1d-9ede-a2de19575ae2)

It will give an error still at this point due to our database , the famous `500`

You will also notice a new sort of output panel running within your container panel , you would usually see one from Visual Studio when running your projects , this will also track errors and changes happening within the container, you can also check this out in logs inside your container on Docker Desktop , fancy huuuh !

| ![Image 1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dbab4b37-f90f-49a0-a6e9-b23b9125e689) | ![Image 2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b1d21a09-51a8-4574-a74a-36d256eefd11) |

## Docker Internal Network
So we have created on Docker Desktop, It went out as 'Production Ready' with release configurations. Our major issue was our Dockerise application could not connect to the database and was giving "Sad Responses". So basically we had everything running normal , the api , the container. The moment we request some data that made use of the database it was like nah fam "You shall not pass".  

Reason for this is 

- Docker has it's own network
- Consider our connection string

  ```markdown
  "ConnectionStrings": {
  "BookStoreDatabaseConnection": "Server=localhost, 1400;Database=BookStoreDb;Trusted_Connection=false;MultipleActiveResultSets=true;Encrypt=false;user id=sa;password=Str0ngPa$$word;"
  },
  ```
  Specifically this part : **`"Server=localhost, 1400;`**
  Visual Studio basically decides what exactly this localhost is (there was this word Inferences)
  
- Keep in mind our container is on its own.
- It does not see `localhost` the same way.
- This is where we rely on Docker's Internal Network to make some magic.

- Head back to your Visual Studio/ Visual Studio Code
- Tweak the conection string by adding  **`host.docker.internal`**
  So now it should be

  ```markdown
  "ConnectionStrings": {
  "BookStoreDatabaseConnection": "Server=host.docker.internal, 1400;Database=BookStoreDb;Trusted_Connection=false;MultipleActiveResultSets=true;Encrypt=false;user id=sa;password=Str0ngPa$$word;"
  },
  ```
  So now its saying lets look at the internal network and broadcast our port from the one specified

- Test internally first
- Run container on Visual Studio
- I usually just click on the port inside the container panel , where port tab is specified
- Did a quick get the books 
  
  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2dd86da3-08e5-46ed-95fc-c7cb55b33ea6)

  Success !!!
  
So now that it's working let's recreate the image 

- Right-click on your BookStore.Api project
- Click on `Open in Terminal` right at the bottom
- This will open your powershell on the right place
- Copy the text below and paste in your command
  
  ```markdown
  dotnet publish --os linux --arch x64 -t:PublishContainer -c Release
  ```
Now you should see 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ddb59c52-eb5a-45d9-9833-156003ec32b4)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8824b9f2-f45b-4d53-b3b2-27a2e1fd10ec)

So you have to understand that images are immutable. Meaning even though we changed the source code , it won't pick up what we have done. Since an image is basically a snapshot that existed at the time we published it the first time.

and kabaam , It tagged that image with latest

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8eb0cd71-9bc1-44f8-82e2-ae2dff575cd2)

Whoop !

So the next step was `docker run`

At this point I kept getting an error for some reason using this  `docker run -p 5000:8080 -p 5001:8081 --rm --name BookStore-DotNetPublish -d bookstore-api-dotnetpublish`

But then it hit me while following the tutorial I was following , I have to be missing something turns out it was the line below within my `csproj` file

```markdown
<ContainerRepository>BookStore.Api.DotNetPublish</ContainerRepository>
```

This was added into my `csproj` file (double click on your api project)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f13367ba-b167-4466-b146-57ab3dae1f4e)

The I right-clicked on the project again to `open in terminal`
Then ran the command `docker run -p 5000:8080 -p 5001:8081 --rm --name BookStore-DotNetPublish -d bookstore-api-dotnetpublish` and whoop whoop

So once I added this , I could check it out on postman too:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/03285927-2f25-4c0b-afa3-09a1ec227ce2)

And WELL THAT'S ALL PEEEOPLES !!!

# Special Thanks
You probably wondering , damn how do you know all of this stuff? I actually had no clue, after 3 days I felt comfortable to use the docs I had created based off what I saw. This is my solution based off an awesome tutorial I watched by **Trevoir Williams**.
Honestly the way he broke this entire process down was so fun. A little bit of head bumps here and there. 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e41cdfa3-857e-4e58-8408-f6ebb9dfab51)

[Video Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UT9l_UfhexE)

Let me explain the process

**`Day 1`**  
Watched the tutorial, made a lot of notes on what's happening.  

**`Day 2`**  
Used the notes and tried to build the SQL Server Database with Docker. This went really quick and was fun too.  
Watched the video again and made notes on the Web API Section and how everything connected.  
Trevoir's solution is on .NET 8; I planned on doing it for .NET 9.  

**`Day 3`**  
Created about 3-4 projects using my own notes. On the 3rd try, I successfully created a containerized ASP.NET Core Web API & SQL Server Database with Docker.  
Once I got this correct using my notes, I thought, wow, this is really cool!  

**`28/12/2025`**  
Did the whole process again and documented it side by side with each step.  


Hoping this helps newbies like myself do the most :) . Next steps , definetly, chill & look at Docker Compose next.
