# ðŸ“¦ Containerizing Your SQL Server Database With Docker 

![Containerizing  Your SQL Server  Database With Docker](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/72b403fa-b7e6-466f-97e9-dedf161332c3)


I found this experiment really cool , I checked out a couple videos on how to do this and basically summed up the best parts that worked really well for me and I'll be breaking it down here.

## Connecting SQL Server To Docker

Use `Win + R`  and type in cmd:
This will open the Run dialog, and typing "cmd" launches the Windows Command Prompt.

Once this is completed run the `docker` command:
This will let you know that docker is actually on your machine

Once you have confirmed all is good under the hood , copy the command below and paste it into your terminal 

```markdown
docker pull mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server
```

Understanding Docker Pull Command 

The URL `mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server` breaks down as:
- `mcr.microsoft.com`: Microsoft's container registry
- `mssql/server`: Image path/name

When `docker pull` runs:
1. Recognizes URL as registry path
2. Connects to Microsoft's registry 
3. Downloads SQL Server image

Think of it like an app store - the URL specifies which "store" (registry) and which "app" (image) to download.

You should have something like this:

| During Download | Completed Dowload |
|--------|--------|
| ![During Download](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6db8c640-eb65-4afc-ba5b-170445396960) <br> | ![Completed Dowload](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6bb301c1-8d48-4977-90e9-74355c542a0d)  |

If for some reason you dont believe you terminal and actually want to see if its pulled that image , Head over to your Docker Desktop. 
Click on `images`, then you should see the image in there

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/15ff18f0-3425-4cde-a385-51efd368babc)

After we have confirmed all that, lets run another command:

```markdown
docker run --name my-sqlserver -e ACCEPT_EULA=Y -e SA_PASSWORD=Str0ngPa$$word -p 1400:1433 -d mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server
```
 
Breaking down this command:
This command configures and runs a SQL Server instance in a container by accepting the license, setting an admin password, mapping ports, and pulling the SQL Server image. 

1. **`--name my-sqlserver`**  
   - This just means we giving our container a name , its not needed , but if not used a random name will be generated for it.
     
2. **`ACCEPT_EULA=Y`**  
   - Accepts SQL Server's license terms to run without prompts.  

3. **`SA_PASSWORD=Str0ngPa$$word`**  
   - Sets the password for the `SA` (System Administrator) account, which is the default admin user in SQL Server.  
   - Think of the installation process when using windows , we use windows authentication to connect to a database using our machine name and current windows user, but since we using docker and its being containerized, there's no real specification of windows, mac and Linux authentication etc , how do we fix that ? because in essence we are cant really connect to a default user on our computer and  I think this step will apply to all operating systems using docker , check me if I'm wrong. That's why we using the SA_Password, its the default user/system admin , so everytime you setting up a database engine in SQL server , you get this SA User , this can be any password , but I'm just putting in strong password. 

4. **`-p 1400:1433`**  
   - Maps port `1400` on the host machine to port `1433`, which SQL Server uses by default.  
   - By default, SQL Server listens on port `1433`, so if you donâ€™t specify a mapping, it will always use this port.  
   - On a Windows machine with SQL Server already installed, port `1433` may be in use. To avoid conflicts, you map it to a different port, like `1400`. On Mac or Linux, where SQL Server might not be installed, you can use `1433:1433` directly.  

5. **`mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server`**  
   - Specifies the SQL Server image from Microsoft's container registry.  

Once you hit enter you should see :

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0c418e7f-0899-4f35-be3d-987def7ddc3f)

Docker will show you a long string of random letters and numbers after hitting enter, like this:

```
e2b5c1f36a8b85e6b3c471d2b763e2878bf7f0332db4db838a123456789abcd
```

This is called the **container ID**. Itâ€™s basically a unique name that Docker gives to the container you just created and started. Think of it as a special "tag" that Docker uses to keep track of your container.

If you got any errors during this process , it is most likely a typo referenced as : `docker: invalid reference format.`

So now we should see this in our Docker Desktop under **`Images`**

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f77a33d6-d29b-4ffb-aa8a-f47c03197931)

Something to note , some tutorials referenced the command like this:

```markdown
docker run --name my-sqlserver -e 'ACCEPT_EULA=Y' -e 'SA_PASSWORD=Str0ngPa$$word' -p 1400:1433 -d mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server
```

This did not work for me , reason why was the single quotes we placed on the parameters like `'ACCEPT_EULA=Y'`. It still ran our container, but not correctly because I realized that the container kept stopping which shouldnt be normal, It would run for like 5 seconds then stop.

But thankfully you Docker Desktop Offers a nice UI to pick these up.

You can click on the three dots and see some information from your container:

Like opening the terminal to do some fancy stuff. So what we did was looked inside the box, I mean container.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3448ebf3-3622-490a-ad5c-07d8cace3109)

The first time you `view details` of your container and head over to the inspect tab , you will notice alot of `JSON`, Docker allows you to click the switch above which says `Raw JSON` this will allow you to see a more user friendly setup, like the one im showing above.

Now the problem with running the command with the single quotes is

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/62479ce2-20b6-49a4-a5ac-a4fa3b3e7ec4)

You can see an extra single quote added to our ENVs within Inspect which did not play nice with the runnings of the database on docker .

## Connecting To The SQL Server Database from Docker
So now that we have sucessfully connected our SQL Server Database to Docker, let's try and do the reverse UNO by connecting to the SQL Server database from Docker. We could use the Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio, but I don't think this will be avaible on Linux and Mac. so as an alternative we can go for [**`Azure Data Studio`**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure-data-studio/download-azure-data-studio?tabs=win-install%2Cwin-user-install%2Credhat-install%2Cwindows-uninstall%2Credhat-uninstall#download-azure-data-studio). I won't be going into detail about Azure Data Studio , but I will give a light introduction as to what it is: Azure Data Studio is a lightweight, cross-platform data management and development tool with connectivity to popular cloud and on-premises databases. Azure Data Studio supports Windows, macOS, and Linux, with immediate capability to connect to Azure SQL and SQL Server. 


Once you have your Azure Data Studio up and running, you can check-in and see whats up:
Its giving Visual Studio Code, Im not gonna lie!

Lets create the connection to our Database

Click on **`New Connection`** in the right corner, you will see the pop up in the left side.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bf0b5365-0aac-407f-a71f-9365987098ab)

Make sure that your Docker Container for the database is running within the Docker Desktop , if not , you will get an error , probably saying its unable to access or find our connection:

The information filled in should look something like this :

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f3cd9bbd-d201-43d1-8b21-49e81cecc231)

So something cool about having our database dockerized is that we can also go back and look at our ENV Variables like we did before :) , sweet

Then once you have specified all the information needed , lets connect!

You might see this pop up 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9ae612d3-ccf8-435b-9565-503bc7b9117c)


Just enable and now you should see you connected database, AWESOME !!!!

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/90b2abc9-ff82-40d6-9d7d-4d2f5be36cf5)

you will notice that :

OS Version is 
**`Ubuntu 22.04`**

Keep in mind we are still on our windows machine 
but the OS Version is specified as **`Ubuntu`**, so that what the container does , its running in the docker environment , which we can say Linux , but it mirrors the environment needed for SQL Server to be able to run
