# ðŸ“¦ Containerizing Your SQL Server Database With Docker 

I found this experiment really cool , I checked out a couple videos on how to do this and basically summed up the best parts that worked really well for me and I'll be breaking it down here.

## Connecting SQL Server To Docker

Use `Win + R`  and type in cmd:
This will open the Run dialog, and typing "cmd" launches the Windows Command Prompt.

Once this is completed run the `docker` command:
This will let you know that docker is actually on your machine

Once you have confirmed all is good under the hood , copy the command below and paste it into your terminal 

```markdown
docker pull mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server
```

Understanding Docker Pull Command 

The URL `mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server` breaks down as:
- `mcr.microsoft.com`: Microsoft's container registry
- `mssql/server`: Image path/name

When `docker pull` runs:
1. Recognizes URL as registry path
2. Connects to Microsoft's registry 
3. Downloads SQL Server image

Think of it like an app store - the URL specifies which "store" (registry) and which "app" (image) to download.

You should have something like this:

| During Download | Completed Dowload |
|--------|--------|
| ![During Download](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6db8c640-eb65-4afc-ba5b-170445396960) <br> | ![Completed Dowload](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6bb301c1-8d48-4977-90e9-74355c542a0d)  |

If for some reason you dont believe you terminal and actually want to see if its pulled that image , Head over to your Docker Desktop. 
Click on `images`, then you should see the image in there

After we have confirmed all that, lets run another command:

```markdown
docker run --name my-sqlserver -e ACCEPT_EULA=Y -e SA_PASSWORD=Str0ngPa$$word -p 1400:1433 -d mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server
```
 
Breaking down this command:
This command configures and runs a SQL Server instance in a container by accepting the license, setting an admin password, mapping ports, and pulling the SQL Server image. 

1. **`--name my-sqlserver`**  
   - This just means we giving our container a name , its not needed , but if not used a random name will be generated for it.
     
2. **`ACCEPT_EULA=Y`**  
   - Accepts SQL Server's license terms to run without prompts.  

3. **`SA_PASSWORD=Str0ngPa$$word`**  
   - Sets the password for the `SA` (System Administrator) account, which is the default admin user in SQL Server.  
   - Think of the installation process when using windows , we use windows authentication to connect to a database using our machine name and current windows user, but since we using docker and its being containerized, there's no real specification of windows, mac and Linux authentication etc , how do we fix that ? because in essence we are cant really connect to a default user on our computer and  I think this step will apply to all operating systems using docker , check me if I'm wrong. That's why we using the SA_Password, its the default user/system admin , so everytime you setting up a database engine in SQL server , you get this SA User , this can be any password , but I'm just putting in strong password. 

4. **`-p 1400:1433`**  
   - Maps port `1400` on the host machine to port `1433`, which SQL Server uses by default.  
   - By default, SQL Server listens on port `1433`, so if you donâ€™t specify a mapping, it will always use this port.  
   - On a Windows machine with SQL Server already installed, port `1433` may be in use. To avoid conflicts, you map it to a different port, like `1400`. On Mac or Linux, where SQL Server might not be installed, you can use `1433:1433` directly.  

5. **`mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server`**  
   - Specifies the SQL Server image from Microsoft's container registry.  

Once you hit enter you should see :

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0c418e7f-0899-4f35-be3d-987def7ddc3f)

Docker will show you a long string of random letters and numbers after hitting enter, like this:

```
e2b5c1f36a8b85e6b3c471d2b763e2878bf7f0332db4db838a123456789abcd
```

This is called the **container ID**. Itâ€™s basically a unique name that Docker gives to the container you just created and started. Think of it as a special "tag" that Docker uses to keep track of your container.

If you got any errors during this process , it is most likely a typo referenced as : `docker: invalid reference format.`

So now we should see this in our Docker Desktop under **`Images`**

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f77a33d6-d29b-4ffb-aa8a-f47c03197931)

Something to note , some tutorials referenced the command like this:

```markdown
docker run --name my-sqlserver -e 'ACCEPT_EULA=Y' -e 'SA_PASSWORD=Str0ngPa$$word' -p 1400:1433 -d mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server
```

This did not work for me , reason why was the single quotes we placed on the parameters like `'ACCEPT_EULA=Y'`. It still ran our container, but not correctly because I realized that the container kept stopping which shouldnt be normal, It would run for like 5 seconds then stop.

But thankfully you Docker Desktop Offers a nice UI to pick these up.

You can click on the three dots and see some information from your container:

Like opening the terminal to do some fancy stuff. So what we did was looked inside the box, I mean container.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3448ebf3-3622-490a-ad5c-07d8cace3109)

The first time you `view details` of your container and head over to the inspect tab , you will notice alot of `JSON`, Docker allows you to click the switch above which says `Raw JSON` this will allow you to see a more user friendly setup, like the one im showing above.

Now the problem with running the command with the single quotes is

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/62479ce2-20b6-49a4-a5ac-a4fa3b3e7ec4)

You can see an extra single quote added to our ENVs within Inspect which didnt play nice

## Connecting To The SQL Server Database from Docker

So now that we have sucessfully connected our SQL Server Database to Docker, lets try and do the reverse UNO by connecting to the SQL Server database from Docker. We could use the Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio, but I don't think this will be avaible on Linux and Mac
