# üê≥ ASP.NET Core API & SQL Server Database With Docker Compose

![Containerizing  Your ASP NET Core API  With Docker Compose](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9e0e4f8a-d52c-4e59-9582-f9c1d71c9a93)

We've made it !!! Docker Compose , the little-bit-complex solution. This was a head scratch at first. Im still not sure if its 100%. Like we say "If it works don't touch it". Ive been working with docker for quite a while and realized there is so many ways you can do this.
After watching so many different tutorials, literally everyone has their own way of doing this flow with an API and SQL Server Database, thankfully I didnt end up going down a rabbit hole of them since I know exactly what I wanted. This tutorial will go alot quicker. 
I assume you did the long tutorialbefore this one with Docker or have an idea of how apps can be containerized and used with Docker. This is about simplifying that process.

## Setting Up the Web API
Note we are still using **`.NET 9`**. This time it should be slightly quicker, since I kinda know what im doing and I made it easier for you. **`clone`** this repo [Music Store](https://github.com/lukepadiachy/music-store) and set your branch to `starting-point` then make sure to run the project, If all is well then go off. Ill be posting the end result to `main`. Remeber to add `/swagger` at the end of your url to see the view.

### Install the packages

**`Entityframeworkcore`**
**`Entityframeworkcore.Tools`**
**`Entityframeworkcore.Design`**
**`Entityframeworkcore.SqlServer`**

Don't forget to save and rebuild your solution.


## Organizing the Project Structure

- **Create Folders**: Organize the project by creating folders (e.g. Data, Model).  
- **Create `Album` and `AlbumContext`**:  
- Define an `Album` class to represent your data model.

  ```markdown
  namespace MusicStore.Model
  {
    public class Album
    {
        public int Id { get; set; }
        public string Title { get; set; }
        public string Artist { get; set; }
        public int ReleaseYear { get; set; }
        public string Genre { get; set; }
    }
  }
  ```  

- Set up `AlbumContext` to handle database operations using Entity Framework.
  
   ```markdown
  using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;
  using MusicStore.Model;

  namespace MusicStore.Data
  {
    public class AlbumContext : DbContext
    {
        public AlbumContext(DbContextOptions<AlbumContext> options): base(options)
        {
        }
        public DbSet<Album> Albums { get; set; }
    }
  }
  ``` 

## Configuring the Database

- **Register `DBContext` in `Program.cs`**: Register your `AlbumContext` for dependency injection.

  ```markdown
  builder.Services.AddDbContext<AlbumContext>(options =>
  options.UseSqlServer(builder.Configuration.GetConnectionString("MusicStoreContext")));
  ```
- **Add Initial Seed Data**: Populate the database with sample data for testing. 
  We basically going to create a kind-of database, we can actually use code to do this and populate that database at the same time. This happens within our `Program.cs too`. You don't have to do this in code. DEMO VIBES BASICALLY

  ```markdown
  using (var scope = app.Services.CreateScope())
  {
    var context = scope.ServiceProvider.GetRequiredService<AlbumContext>();
    context.Database.Migrate();
  }
  ```
  **`Migrate()`** | Will create the database if it does not exist 

- **Add Migration**: Use Entity Framework migrations to set up your database schema.
  Make sure to build your solution first then do this.
  In you `Package Manager Console` Terminal and type

  ```markdown
  add-migration InitialMigration
  ```
  Once build is succesfull you show have a new folder in the project called `Migrations` and two files in it `20241229190716_InitialMigration` & `AlbumContextModelSnapshot.cs`
  **`20241229190716_InitialMigration`** | This class creates the "Albums" table in the database.
  **`AlbumContextModelSnapshot.cs`** | This class represents the current structure of the "Albums" table in the database.

  After Adding our migration we can actually add in the code that will populate our database with info in our scope method inside the `Program.cs`

  ```markdown
  if (!context.Albums.Any()) 
  {
    context.Albums.AddRange(
        new Album { Artist = "Chessy HD", Genre = "Afrikaans Rap", ReleaseYear = 2024, Title = "Whatever You Want" }
        );
    context.SaveChanges();
  }
  ```
  
- **Add Connection String**: Add a connection string in `appsettings.json` (start with localhost for development).  
  - Click View
  - Click `SQL Sever Object Explorer`
  - Click on `Sql Server` | This is where you can see your databases
  - If you want to get the connection to a specific database there.
  - Right-click on one or however many you have & click on properties
  - Scroll right up and copy copy copy the `Connection String`
  - Head over to `appsettings.json`
    
    ```markdown
    "ConnectionStrings": {
    "MusicStoreContext": "Data Source=(localdb)\\MSSQLLocalDB;Initial Catalog=AlbumDb;Integrated Security=True;Connect Timeout=30;Encrypt=False;Trust Server Certificate=False;Application Intent=ReadWrite;Multi Subnet Failover=False"
    },
    ``` 
    You string might look the same but watch out, You will have `Catalog=master` once you paste this , make sure to change that name to a database name of your choosing.
    At this point you have no database.

- **Run Code and Check Database**: Ensure the database is created and the data is seeded correctly. 
  - Run your application
  - Click the refresh button in your `SQL Sever Object Explorer` left corner to see if you database was added, make sure you looking at the `Database` folder too.
  - If you confirm it's there , be sure to check if there is info inside by clicking on your database, click on `Tables`, Right click on the Table with dbo.(The name of your DbSet specified in the Context file)and `View Data` 
  
- **Side-Quest**:
  Just to make sure we can actually see the data within swagger , lets create a new endpoint in `Program.cs`.

  ```markdown
  app.MapGet("/albums", async (AlbumContext db) =>
  {
    return await db.Albums.ToListAsync();
  });
  ```
  Make sure to save, run the application and check if the endpoint is there.


## Containerizing the Application
You can either add a file inside your project and call it `Dockerfile` or just use the `Docker Support` option when adding a docker file to your project. If you not sure on how to do this , head over to [here](https://github.com/lukepadiachy/docker-for-beginners/blob/main/docker-essentials/2.ASP%20DotNet%20Core%20API%20and%20SQL%20Server%20Database%20with%20Docker.md).

Right off the bat you can actually run this, but when trying to build this docker image from the Dockerfile within the terminal
- Right-click on your API project.
- Then to the bottom and `Open in Terminal`
- Type in `dir` to make sure you in a path where there is in-fact a `Dockerfile`
- Then run this command, with your own name or however haha 

  ```markdown
  docker build -t lukepadiachy/musicstore:latest .
  ```
  `-t` | means tag and the dot at the end just means within THIS folder

  Once you hit run it will clock out quickly:

  ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b8f3a547-b663-4ac6-8046-6ca462f6d591)

  because some of the auto-generated information mixes up the paths in a weird way. 

**`Edit Paths in Dockerfile`**: Adjust file paths in the Dockerfile as needed.

We will do this section for section

**`Before`** 

```markdown
# This stage is used to build the service project
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:9.0 AS build
ARG BUILD_CONFIGURATION=Release
WORKDIR /src
COPY ["MusicStore/MusicStore.csproj", "MusicStore/"] # Do not need a folder within a folder as we already in a new folder called /src and place a dot infront for the other one 
RUN dotnet restore "./MusicStore/MusicStore.csproj" # Change too
COPY . .
WORKDIR "/src/MusicStore" # removed since we got this in here already 
RUN dotnet build "./MusicStore.csproj" -c $BUILD_CONFIGURATION -o /app/build
```

**`After`**

```markdown
# This stage is used to build the service project
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:9.0 AS build
ARG BUILD_CONFIGURATION=Release
WORKDIR /src
COPY ["MusicStore.csproj", "."]
RUN dotnet restore "MusicStore.csproj"
COPY . .
RUN dotnet build "MusicStore.csproj" -c $BUILD_CONFIGURATION -o /app/build
```

**Last edit for the second section of the dockerfile**

**`Before`**

```markdown
# This stage is used to publish the service project to be copied to the final stage
FROM build AS publish
ARG BUILD_CONFIGURATION=Release
RUN dotnet publish "./MusicStore.csproj" -c $BUILD_CONFIGURATION -o /app/publish /p:UseAppHost=false # Remove ./
```

**`After`**

```markdown
# This stage is used to publish the service project to be copied to the final stage
FROM build AS publish
ARG BUILD_CONFIGURATION=Release
RUN dotnet publish "MusicStore.csproj" -c $BUILD_CONFIGURATION -o /app/publish /p:UseAppHost=false # Remove ./
```

After those tweaks , Lets run the terminal again 

```markdown
  docker build -t lukepadiachy/musicstore:latest .
  ```

After learning this way of doing the dockerfile and paths , It's made the abit less complex now when specifying paths, most my errors came from trying to fix paths or not finding any files needed

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3cc69278-b72a-45fe-96de-67009f742ead)

Now we got our image 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e15eabfb-ca04-401f-9995-bc2c81abfb98)

You can remove the extra containers relating to your project that Visual Studio created for you the moment you added the docker file 

If we try to run the application now , It will crash 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0057c167-b8ea-40ee-8b60-03d11808c66e)

**`Reason:`**
Its running on my computer but not really running , because Docker is a isolated environment, you can't connect to local host the same way we connect to it on our pc, since its more of a windows feature. Docker is a very Linux based.

## Setting Up SQL Server with Docker
Add a SQL Server instance for your application to connect to.

- **Pull SQL Server Image**: The official SQL Server Docker image.
To pull this specific docker image you can say in your terminal:

```markdown
docker run -e "ACCEPT_EULA=Y" -e "MSSQL_SA_PASSWORD=Password626!" -p 1433:1433 --name music-storedb -d mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server:2022-latest 
```
`-e` | Specifies an environment variable
`-p` | Specifies the port , `1433:1433` is the standard port for SQL Server
`-d` | Detach Mode , so you can be outside of the terminal 
`mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server:2022-latest` | Name of container

Once you hit enter , if you do not have the image it will pull one for you.

Now you can see it running in Docker Desktop

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1b5d6c1f-93e3-4a97-9245-a9065151364b)
  
- **Connect to the Container**: Use SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) or Object Explorer to connect to the SQL Server container for demonstration purposes.
  If you're using `SQL Object Explorer` like me
  - Click Next to the refresh button to add a new connection
  - Fill in the information similar to what is seen below , note the password is the one you gave when you ran your command. Note that the Trust Certificate was made true

    ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fa1e0f62-5986-4d35-a596-2f191d968629)

  - Now you can do the same thing we did for the local host db in terms of the connection string and the process of running it aswell
  - Remove old Connection String in `appsettings.json` and replace with the one below (The original one you copy is really long and doesnt work too nice, so we tweaked it). Make sure you using the same password you used for the command

    ```markdown
    "Server=localhost,1433;Database=AlbumDb;User ID=sa;Password=Password626!;Trust Server Certificate=True;"
    ``` 
If you try to run this it will still crash because of localhost , because they running on seperate networks , which is why we aiming for docker compose.
However you can bypass it by saying **`Server=host.docker.internal`** which will add the table to that database and run the container.

## Using Docker Compose
Simplify the process by defining services. Docker Compose is an orchestration tool which can run multiple containers/services at the same time.

- **Add Docker Compose File**: Create a `docker-compose.yml` file to manage multiple containers.
  To add docker compose , you can do it manually or use `Container Orchestrator Support`
  - Select `Docker Compose`
  - Click OK
  - Target Linux and OK again
  - Once you've done that , you will see the `docker-compose` in the root of your project/solution
  - Click in `docker-compose.yml` You will see this was generated for you too.
This docker compose file as is, only runs one container , because it has no idea about our database 

- **Edit Docker Compose File**: Adjust the configuration to include our application and SQL Server.
  In otherwords , we going to tweak this too !

  ```markdown
  services:
  musicstore: # This contains our DockerFile
    build:
      context: ./MusicStore
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"  # Binding the ports
      - "8081:8081"
    depends_on:  # This application will not run until the SQL Server is done
      - sqlserver 
    environment:
      - ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Development # Reason for this is so we can still use swagger , but ofcourse in production different ball game
      - ASPNETCORE_URLS=http://+:8080
    networks:
      - music-network # The communicaator !!!
    restart: on-failure # just incase it fails , restart it 

  sqlserver: # Database service, whatever is placed here will be the name of your service
    image: "mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server:2022-latest" # Fetch an image
    environment:
      SA_PASSWORD: "Password626!"  # Envrionment variables from the command
      ACCEPT_EULA: "Y"
    ports:
      - "1433:1433"
    volumes:
     - sqlvolume:/var/opt/mssql  # STUBBORN DATA
    networks:
      - music-network

  networks:
    music-network:

  volumes:
    sqlvolume:
  ```  


- **Change Connection String**: Update the connection string in your application to match the Docker Compose setup.
Last but not least !!!
We finally get to connect use our sqlserver service instead of localhost to run our database container...
So now the connection string should be

```markdown
"ConnectionStrings": {
  "MusicStoreContext": "Server=sqlserver;Database=AlbumDb;User ID=sa;Password=Password626!;Trust Server Certificate=True;"
},
```
Before we run , head over to the terminal , make sure you in the correct `dir`, this time you want to be in a path that has `docker-compose.yml`.

So to make sure everything is sweet , clear and have a clean build , I deleted all the containers and images for fun.

Now inside you terminal making sure you in the directory where the `docker-compose.yml` is run :

```markdown
docker-compose up --build
``` 

and wooohoo !

**`Side-Quests`**
Since we know we are able to `GET` info from the database , we should try posting too.. also to test volume. We going to create a a new endpoint.

Add into your `Program.cs`

```markdown
app.MapPost("/albums", async (Album album, AlbumContext db) =>
{
    db.Albums.Add(album);
    await db.SaveChangesAsync();
    return Results.Created($"/albums/{album.Id}", album);
});
```
Deleted all my old containers for fun

Once added run build in the terminal again 

Whooop , success !
