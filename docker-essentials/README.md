I remembered at the start of the repo I mentioned **"Definetly plan on adding more info as I learn more on this topic!"**. Well this is the extension of my experiments and trying out different things with Docker. 

# 📝 Things to note:
- We assume you have already set up Docker on your Machine
- All the info I found is on the internet..
- Most will be .NET Related
- Im still a baby..
- This is all about experimenting
