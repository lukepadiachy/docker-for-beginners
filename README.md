Welcome to **Docker for Beginners**! Basically I tried Docker for the first time on `22/12/2024` completed a few tutorials, am I a professional ? NOPE, Will you encounter some errors? Well if you starting out like I did , most likely (even with instructions). I'll basically be taking you through my process on how I managed to get docker up and running and do some cool things with Docker in the process too. Most these have documentation. I believe the main reason I cooked this up was to ensure that If anyone got stuck along the way like I did with some things between the guides, these small troubleshoots I did got me pass them. Definetly plan on adding more info as I learn more on this topic! 

# 📝 Things to note:
- This approach may or may not work for you , if not thats okay :).
- All the info I found is on the internet..
- My IDE of choice was [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) throughout the process, Plans for doing it on [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) too
- Its not that deep, I hope.
