# ‚öôÔ∏è Setting Up Docker

Docker is like a pizza box for software. Imagine you order a pizza with all your favorite toppings (your app's code, libraries, and settings). The pizza box keeps it fresh, neatly packed, and ready to go. No matter where you take the pizza‚Äîhome, a party, or a road trip, it‚Äôs still the same hot pizza.
With Docker, your app is like that pizza: packed, portable and guaranteed to work the same way everywhere! üçï

### Things to note:
Prior to looking at the video below, I first wanted to install docker as is , till I realized a lot more goes into it than just PLUG & PLAY after looking at the docs (haha).

I would suggest looking at the documentation aswell, it's always good to have your own understanding of what something does and how it moves.
